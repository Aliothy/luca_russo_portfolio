            <p>Hello! I’m Luca, a PhD Engineering student at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
                This portfolio aims to show some of the engineering projects I’ve worked on throughout the years to better 
                explain what is covered in my resume. 
            </p>
            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I’m an Aerospace and Mechatronics Engineer passionate about robotics and space.
                The ability to make a system move autonomously and make it aware of the surrounding environment has always amused me. 
                It is why I pursued a master’s degree in Mechatronics Engineering where I gained the knowledge and skills necessary to design 
                and build such systems. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to 
                create innovative and practical solutions that can make a difference in the world.
                In my free time, I love sports, mainly because I have been a wrestler since I was a kid!
